# AI Agent Guidelines

These instructions apply to any AI assistant working in this repository.

## Testing
- All tests must always pass.
- Run the full test suite (`node --test`) after any change that could affect behavior.
- If tests cannot be run, state why and provide the closest possible validation.
- Use the summary reporter when you want a compact output (`node --test --test-reporter ./tests/helpers/table-reporter.js`).

## Test Structure
- Place pure logic tests under `tests/unit/`.
- Place UI/DOM interaction tests under `tests/ui/`.
- Shared utilities belong in `tests/helpers/`.

## JavaScript Structure
- Keep browser logic split across the focused scripts in `scripts/` and only bootstrap in `app.js`.
- Update `index.html` script order when adding/removing script files.
